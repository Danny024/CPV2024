# CPV2024
This is a repository containing most of my computer vision algorithm from traditional/classical image processing  and computer vision algorithms to state-of-the art deep learning models such as SAM (Segment-Anything-Model), Yolov8, UNet to 3D reconstruction such as NerF's and Gaussian Splatting.
<br>
<br>
This is an arsenal of scalable ready-to-use and reliable computer vision codes to facilitate computer vision development life cycle. This codes can easily be adapted for Robotics application on ROS1/ROS2 and enhancing Human-Machine-Teaming

<br>
<br>

I would be updating the code base within the time frame of 2 month.

Keep your fingers crossed. ðŸ¤ž

Projects to be Carried Out.
1.  A robust ROS WRAPPPER for yolov9 and yolov10 algorithm in C++
2. A robust ROS wrapper for autodistil2 and Florence-2 algortithm to enhance ontology for image-text in robotics application
3. A robust ROS WRAPPER for the SAM algorithm ..
4. A robust ROS and ROS2 wrapper for the 3D Gaussian algorithm ...
